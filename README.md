## Other Commands

Bundles the app into static files for production.

## Setting the Google Sheets File

To run correctly, this project parses data from google sheets â€“ the specific google sheets structure that needs to be used will be explained at a later point.

To setting the schedule, here are the special keywords.

| dayType    | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| Conference | Conference Day for Teachers |
| Extended | Extended Homeroom Schedule |
| Homeroom | Normal Homeroom Day |
| Regular | Regular School Day |
| TF | Thursday-Friday Schedule|
| No School | No School |

## Next Steps for this project.

1. Organize the code so it relies on fewer api calls and less javascript
2. Rework the README so this could be run by anyone
3. Optimize the code
